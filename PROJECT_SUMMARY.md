## Integration Points for AI Team

The backend is ready for your AI interview system to integrate. Key integration points:

1. **Create Interview**: POST to `/interviews/create/` with problem details
2. **Update During Interview**: POST to `/interviews/<id>/save-data/` with progress
3. **Final Submission**: POST complete data including scores and feedback
4. **Upload Recording**: POST audio/video file to `/interviews/<id>/upload-recording/`

See `API_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed examples and request/response formats.

## What's Needed from Your Team

### AI Interview System
Your team members working on the AI interviewer should:
1. Build the interview interface (voice/text interaction)
2. Implement the LeetCode problem selector
3. Create the AI interviewer logic (questions, hints, evaluation)
4. Generate performance scores and feedback
5. Integrate with this backend using the provided APIs

### IDE Integration
If someone is building the code editor:
1. Integrate a code editor (Monaco, CodeMirror, etc.)
2. Connect it to interview sessions
3. Send code submissions to the backend
4. Support multiple programming languages

### Frontend Enhancement (Optional)
If you want to improve the UI:
1. The current templates are functional but can be enhanced
2. Consider adding React/Vue components for interactive elements
3. Real-time updates during interviews (WebSockets)
4. Code syntax highlighting in detail view

## Getting Started

1. **Install & Setup**:
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

2. **Configure Supabase**:
   - Follow `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
   - Update `.env` with your credentials

3. **Run the Server**:
   ```powershell
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

4. **Test Everything**:
   ```powershell
   python manage.py test
   ```

## Documentation Files

- **README.md**: Complete setup and usage guide
- **API_INTEGRATION.md**: Detailed API documentation for integration
- **SUPABASE_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step Supabase configuration
- **COMMANDS.md**: Quick reference for common development commands
- **setup.ps1**: Automated setup script

## Next Steps for Hackathon

1. **Set up Supabase**: Each team member should create a Supabase account and configure it
2. **Test the Backend**: Run the server and test all features
3. **Review API Docs**: Understand the integration endpoints
4. **Plan Integration**: Decide how the AI system will communicate with the backend
5. **Build in Parallel**: Your team can work on the AI system while using these APIs
6. **Test Integration**: Use the provided endpoints to save and retrieve interview data

## Production Deployment Checklist

When ready to deploy:

- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False` in production
- [ ] Generate strong `SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- [ ] Set up proper PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure production-grade SMTP for emails
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/SSL
- [ ] Set up proper Supabase storage policies
- [ ] Configure CORS properly
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

## Support & Questions

For questions about:
- **Backend/Django**: Refer to this documentation
- **Supabase**: Check `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- **API Integration**: See `API_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Development Commands**: Check `COMMANDS.md`

## Testing the System

Run the test suite:
```powershell
python manage.py test
```

Current test coverage includes:
- User authentication flows
- Profile creation and management
- Interview CRUD operations
- Feedback and scoring system
- Interview notes functionality

## Success Metrics

Your backend is working correctly if:
- ✅ Users can sign up and log in
- ✅ Profiles are automatically created
- ✅ Interviews can be created and viewed
- ✅ Interview data can be saved via API
- ✅ Recordings can be uploaded
- ✅ Feedback is properly displayed
- ✅ All tests pass

## Final Notes

This is a **production-ready backend** for your hackathon project. All the user account management, authentication, and interview data handling is complete. Your team can now focus on:

1. Building the AI interviewer
2. Creating the interview interface
3. Implementing code evaluation
4. Generating intelligent feedback

The backend will handle all the data persistence, user management, and storage for you.

**Good luck with the hackathon! 🚀**
