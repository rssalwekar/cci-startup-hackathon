# API Integration Guide

This document explains how to integrate the AI interview system with the Django backend.

## Base URL

http://localhost:8000
```

## Authentication

All interview-related endpoints require authentication. Users must be logged in.

### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up: `POST /signup/`
2. User logs in: `POST /login/`
3. Session cookie is set automatically
4. All subsequent requests include the session cookie

## Example Integration Flow

### 1. User Starts Interview
```python
# Frontend creates interview
interview_data = {
    "title": "Practice Session",
    "problem_name": "Valid Parentheses",
    "problem_description": "Given a string containing just...",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "language": "python"
}

# Interview is created, get interview_id
interview_id = created_interview.id
```

### 2. During Interview
```python
# Periodically save progress
progress_data = {
    "status": "in_progress",
    "code": current_code,
    "transcript": current_transcript
}

requests.post(f"/interviews/{interview_id}/save-data/", json=progress_data)
```

### 3. After Interview
```python
# Save final data
final_data = {
    "status": "completed",
    "code": final_code,
    "transcript": full_transcript,
    "scores": calculated_scores,
    "feedback_report": generated_report,
    "strengths": identified_strengths,
    "areas_for_improvement": identified_improvements,
    "feedback_points": detailed_feedback,
    "notes": interview_notes
}

requests.post(f"/interviews/{interview_id}/save-data/", json=final_data)

# Upload recording
files = {'recording': recording_file}
requests.post(f"/interviews/{interview_id}/upload-recording/", files=files)
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

#### 404 Not Found
```json
{
    "error": "Interview not found"
}
```

#### 403 Forbidden
```json
{
    "error": "You don't have permission to access this interview"
}
```

#### 400 Bad Request
```json
{
    "error": "Invalid data format"
}
```

#### 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
    "error": "An error occurred: <error details>"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always update status**: Update the interview status as it progresses
2. **Save incrementally**: Save interview data periodically, not just at the end
3. **Handle errors**: Always check response status and handle errors gracefully
4. **Upload recordings last**: Upload the recording after all other data is saved
5. **Use timestamps**: Include accurate timestamps for notes
6. **Categorize feedback**: Organize feedback points by category for better display
7. **Validate data**: Ensure scores are between 0-100 and status values are valid

## Testing

### Using curl (Windows PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create interview
$body = @{
    title = "Test Interview"
    problem_name = "Test Problem"
    problem_description = "Test Description"
    difficulty = "medium"
    language = "python"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/interviews/create/" `
    -Method POST `
    -Body $body `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -SessionVariable session

# Save data
$updateBody = @{
    status = "completed"
    code = "def solution(): pass"
    scores = @{
        overall = 85
        communication = 90
    }
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/interviews/1/save-data/" `
    -Method POST `
    -Body $updateBody `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -WebSession $session
```
