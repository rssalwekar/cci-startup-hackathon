# Video Recording Feature

This document explains the video recording functionality implemented for the AI coding interview platform.

## Overview

The video recording feature allows users to record their entire interview session, including screen capture and audio, which is then displayed on the results page.

## How It Works

### 1. **Browser-Based Recording**
- Uses the **MediaRecorder API** with **getDisplayMedia()** for screen capture
- Records both video (screen) and audio (microphone)
- Supports multiple video codecs with fallback options:
  - Primary: `video/webm;codecs=vp9,opus`
  - Fallback: `video/webm;codecs=vp8,opus`
  - Final fallback: `video/webm`

### 2. **Recording Process**
1. **Start Recording**: User clicks "üé• Start Recording" button
2. **Permission Request**: Browser asks for screen sharing permission
3. **Stream Setup**: Creates MediaRecorder with optimal settings:
   - Video: 1920x1080 @ 30fps, 2.5 Mbps
   - Audio: 44.1kHz, 128 kbps with noise suppression
4. **Data Collection**: Records data in 1-second chunks
5. **Stop Recording**: User clicks "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" or ends interview
6. **Upload**: Video is automatically uploaded to the server

### 3. **File Storage**
- Videos are stored in Django's `media/interview_recordings/` directory
- Filename format: `interview_{timestamp}.webm`
- Database tracks the recording metadata in `InterviewRecording` model

### 4. **Results Page Display**
- Videos are displayed in the results page using HTML5 `<video>` element
- Supports both WebM and MP4 formats for maximum browser compatibility
- Includes video controls (play, pause, seek, volume, fullscreen)

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (JavaScript)
```javascript
// Start recording
async function startVideoRecording() {
    recordingStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({
        video: { mediaSource: 'screen', width: { ideal: 1920 }, height: { ideal: 1080 } },
        audio: { echoCancellation: true, noiseSuppression: true }
    });
    
    mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(recordingStream, options);
    mediaRecorder.start(1000); // 1-second chunks
}

// Stop and upload
async function stopVideoRecording() {
    mediaRecorder.stop();
    const blob = new Blob(recordedChunks, { type: 'video/webm' });
    await uploadVideoToServer(blob);
}
```

### Backend (Django)
```python
@login_required
def upload_video(request):
    video_file = request.FILES['video']
    recording, created = InterviewRecording.objects.get_or_create(session=session)
    recording.video_file = video_file
    recording.save()
    return JsonResponse({'success': True, 'video_url': recording.video_file.url})
```

## User Experience

### Starting a Recording
1. Click "üé• Start Recording" button during interview
2. Browser prompts for screen sharing permission
3. Choose what to share (entire screen, window, or tab)
4. Recording begins automatically
5. Button changes to "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" with pulsing animation

### During Recording
- Button shows red pulsing animation to indicate active recording
- User can continue with interview normally
- If user stops screen sharing, recording automatically stops

### Ending Recording
- Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop Recording" button, OR
- Click "End Interview" (automatically stops recording)
- Video is processed and uploaded to server
- User is redirected to results page where video is displayed

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- **Chrome/Chromium**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Limited support (may require different codec)
- **Edge**: Full support

### Requirements
- HTTPS connection (required for screen capture API)
- Modern browser with MediaRecorder API support
- User permission for screen sharing

## File Sizes and Performance

### Typical File Sizes
- **1 minute recording**: ~15-20 MB
- **10 minute interview**: ~150-200 MB
- **30 minute interview**: ~450-600 MB

### Optimization Features
- Efficient WebM codec with VP9/VP8 compression
- Adaptive bitrate based on content
- Chunked recording to prevent memory issues
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data

## Security and Privacy

### Data Handling
- Videos are stored locally on the server
- Only accessible to the user who created the recording
- No third-party video processing services used
- Videos can be deleted by removing the session

### Permissions
- Users must explicitly grant screen sharing permission
- Recording only starts after user confirmation
- Users can stop recording at any time
- No automatic recording without user action

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Failed to start screen recording"**
   - Ensure HTTPS connection
   - Check browser permissions
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **"No video file provided"**
   - Recording may have failed silently
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Try starting recording again

3. **"Video not displaying"**
   - Check if video file exists in media directory
   - Verify browser supports WebM format
   - Check Django media settings

### Browser Console Messages
- `"Video recording started"` - Recording began successfully
- `"Video blob created, size: X bytes"` - Video processed
- `"Video uploaded successfully"` - Upload completed
- `"Screen sharing ended by user"` - User stopped sharing

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Compression**: Add server-side video compression
2. **Streaming**: Implement real-time video streaming
3. **Analytics**: Add video analytics and insights
4. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with cloud storage services
5. **Transcription**: Add automatic speech-to-text from video audio
6. **Thumbnails**: Generate video thumbnails for quick preview

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Progressive Upload**: Upload video chunks during recording
2. **Background Processing**: Process videos in background tasks
3. **CDN Integration**: Serve videos through content delivery network
4. **Mobile Support**: Optimize for mobile screen recording
